Issue #{issue_number}: {issue_title}

Source files:

MANDATORY CORE ASPECTS (include ALL of these, tailored to THIS issue):
{core_aspects}

Generate a structured analysis in JSON:
{{
  "aspects": [
    {{
      "id": "A1",
      "emoji": "relevant emoji",
      "name": "short name",
      "why": "why this aspect matters for THIS issue",
      "ideal": "how the ideal solution performs on this aspect"
    }}
  ],
  "challenges": [
    {{
      "id": "C1",
      "name": "short name",
      "risk": "what could go wrong",
      "mitigation": "how to avoid it"

    {{
      "id": "E1",
      "scenario": "specific input or scenario",
      "expected": "what should happen"
    }}
  ]
}}

Rules:
- MUST include ALL {num_core} core aspects above (A1-A{num_core}), with "why" and "ideal" tailored to THIS specific issue
- Add 1-5 MORE issue-specific aspects after the core ones (A{next_id}+)
- 5-10 challenges covering: what could break, what traps exist, what the agent might get wrong
- Edge cases: follow Marginal Return of Utility (MRU) - T1 happy path + T2 input + T3 error + T4 boundary per affected function
- CRITICAL: if the issue involves SQL/regex/HTML/embedded DSL, at least 3 edge cases MUST cover cross-boundary scenarios
- CRITICAL: if the issue involves an external SDK, at least 2 edge cases MUST cover return type verification
- Think about what would make a PR reviewer reject the fix
- Think about what would make tests fail"""
